<h1>Hi, I'm Randal 
                          
<h2>About Me</h2>
Experienced in customer interaction, investigation and data management, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of legal frameworks, investigative procedures and evidence collection. At Services Australia, I served as a Payment Accuracy officer, conducting thorough reviews to ensure clients received correct payments, thereby maintaining the integrity of welfare services. Additionally, as a Technical Information officer, I managed and analysed data from various sources, utilising tools such as Teradata SQL, Cloudera Data Lake and SAS Enterprise guide to inform decision making and support data governance initiatives. During my Tenure at Telstra as Subject Matter Expert, I provided expert guidance on complex NBN processes, authored comprehensive training guides and contributed to enhancing customer service efficiency.
